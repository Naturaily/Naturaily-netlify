        that communicate in different ways, so the biggest challenge was to
        figure out the information transfer and processing stream.<br><br>
        Some of Retention Rocket’s features are built upon its integration with
        an&nbsp;external app - Gorgias. It sends emails to the e&#8209;commerce

        a&nbsp;thread on a&nbsp;business owner’s Slack channel. Our task was

        perfectly on every channel.
