      For Etno Cafe’s owners, their website is <strong>a&nbsp;vital way of expanding brand awareness
      and reaching out to new customers</strong>. As&nbsp;such, they wanted it to&nbsp;be performant,
      stable, secure and in&nbsp;line with the newly established look and&nbsp;feel of&nbsp;the brand. 
      <br><br>
      <strong>Information transparency, the ability to&nbsp;easily edit website content, and an&nbsp;increase
      in&nbsp;users’ interactions</strong> were also some of the&nbsp;main goals the client wanted to achieve.
      This was mostly due to&nbsp;the wide range of the&nbsp;offer, the&nbsp;seasonal menus in&nbsp;each
      of the&nbsp;coffee shops, and&nbsp;an&nbsp;overall willingness to&nbsp;keep customers informed. 
    </p>
    <p class="etno-goal__columns-right">
      The new website was designed mostly for marketing and image-building purposes. Nevertheless, the 
      <strong>growth in the&nbsp;number of&nbsp;visitors and B2B leads</strong> was also more than welcome,
      so we needed to&nbsp;develop some integrations with email marketing and lead generation tools
      to accommodate these additional benefits.
      <br><br>
      Summing up, Etno Cafe wanted their new website to be stable, secure and performant, but also visually
      appealing and memorable.
