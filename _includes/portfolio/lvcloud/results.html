        Developing smart grid solutions has helped many Distribution Network
        Operators, as well as the industry in general, begin to understand, plan
        and implement practical solutions for future networks.<br><br>
        LV Cloud application is already used by a couple of companies around
        the world. It helps them to minimize costs and allows informed decisions
        to be made exactly when needed.

        <span>Thanks to the data flowing into the application in real time, energy
        companies know precisely when they have to send a team of engineers to fix
        a failure and when it's going to repair itself.</span>
        This helps to provide continuous energy supply, reduce the response time
        and avoid financial penalties for power outages.

      We have invested in intelligent fuses and fault-location equipment on our
      low-voltage network to reduce the dependency on manual operation to restore
      power, shortening power cut times for our customers.<br><br>
      On our high-voltage network we've carried out significant upgrades to our
      control system, enabling our network to reconfigure itself automatically
      to respond to faults, restoring supplies for our customers more quickly.
