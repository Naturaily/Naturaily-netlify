      PWAs aim to disrupt the mobile app paradigm by bridging the web experience 
      with native app functionality, by using the latest browser technologies to 
      meld the accessibility of the web with the presence of the mobile app.

        Gartner also predicts that, by 2020, <span>Progressive Web Apps (PWA)</span> will 
        replace 50% of consumer-facing apps, given their ability to meld the accessibility 
        of the web with the features of native apps. With cross-browser support and 
        compatibility with mobile-friendly frameworks, such as Vue.js, React and Preact, 
        and Angular, we can expect to see PWAs become a standard for mobile web strategy.
      </p>
      <p class="pwa-predictions_right">
        The wider move toward a progressive web will begin in earnest over the next year. 
        More organizations have come to appreciate the revenue risk of getting left behind 
        and have begun to prepare for a PWA push between now and 2025.
