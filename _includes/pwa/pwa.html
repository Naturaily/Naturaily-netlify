        Progressive Web Applications, created by Google, are a deck of APIs that
        allow for creating fast, reliable, and engaging digital products that have
        the crucial functionalities of both web page and mobile apps. This includes
        offline access, push notifications, home screen shortcuts, and accessibility
        through a regular mobile browser.

        As Google says, PWAs make it easy to delight your users, grow engagement,
        and increase conversion. PWAs may take the place of native and hybrid apps
        because they are fast (unlike hybrid apps) and use a single code base for
        all platforms, as opposed to native apps.
