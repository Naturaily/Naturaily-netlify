            is over for the sprint, the team spends together approximately 2 hours on planning the next steps.</p>

            to On Stage, developers are responsible for managing their tasks. After the branch is merged
            to development, it is the responsibility of the QA and PM to see if everything works as it should,
            as well as schedule and confirm deployment on the production environment.</p>
