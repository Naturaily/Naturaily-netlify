          We start from understanding business’ and users’ needs, then we draw up an action plan and get to prototyping and development. When the product is tested, we show it to the world and wait for the feedback. Based on that, we can make the necessary changes and deliver a polished and profitable digital product.

        In September 2018 Eurobank released a new version of their website. The project was a collaborative effort of several teams of specialists.
        <br><br>
        Among them was Naturaily's content-design team responsible for creating the information architecture of the website, as well as filling it with the right content and creating ready-to-implement CMS templates.
        <br><br>
        The content for over 130 product and informative pages was prepared and implemented in just two months, fully in line with the communication strategy established at the beginning of the cooperation.

          What mattered to us most was for the user not to have any trouble with understanding the texts, what can be hard in the banking industry. Naturaily made it easy to accomplish. They proposed an effective cooperation process, created a specific roadmap that considered tasks being delivered by various teams: an internal Eurobank team, the content project team and the implementation team.
          Their engagement was way beyond the agreed responsibility line!
          I wish everyone with a demanding project such a pro-active team.
