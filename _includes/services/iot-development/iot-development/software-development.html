        When we have created appropriate documentation, as well as know
        all requirements and devices that are going to be your IoT solution,
        we design the server-side architecture and API specification.
      </p>

    <p class="services-section__side">
      While developing an IoT solution, we stick to a microservices
      architecture, which makes it easier to build and maintain an app.
      <br>
      <br>
      The last step before the IoT software development process is
      setting up the server environment. Then, we split the backlog
      into sprints and start coding.
