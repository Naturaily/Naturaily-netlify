        Its basic function is to connect devices or applications to another
        end point. An IoT platform can handle a significant amount of data
        gathered from devices, apps, websites and customers, as well as
        different types of sensors, giving responses in real-time.
        <br><br>
        When choosing the best IoT platform, you should consider your company
        requirements for hardware, real-time access, reports, budget,
        development team and business model.

        Why is it worth starting from the discovery session?
        <span class="services-faq__icon"></span>

        The discovery session is a deep dive into the client's business.
        It helps to understand the real problem that needs to be solved
        and establish the best way to do that. Workshops guarantee that
        both our client and us share the same vision of the solution we
        will be working on.  After three days of working together, we come
        up with a plan on how to solve the stated problem in the cheapest,
        fastest, and most effective way.
        <br><br>
        The discovery session’s outcome is documentation for project
        requirements, potential risks and ways to avoid them, as well as
        a basic roadmap and action plan with the project timeline and costs.
        <br><br>
        The main goal of the discovery session is to find the best way to solve
        our clients' problems and help him or her succeed.

        It was developed at Google and written down by Jake Knapp and
        John Zeratsky in the form of a book titled “Sprint book”.
        In short, the Design Sprint is a five-day process for solving
        problems and testing new ideas. During workshops, the team works
        on a prototype and then shows it to customers to see their reaction.

        We recommend working on a PoC to each of our clients but, most of
        all, it’s recommended when the concept of the product has not been
        fully defined yet. It helps to identify use cases, notice potential
        bottlenecks and find the appropriate solution.
