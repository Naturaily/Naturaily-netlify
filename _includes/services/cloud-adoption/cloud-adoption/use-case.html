    LV Cloud is an IoT application monitoring and taking care of the local
    energy grid. The app detects problems with electricity networks, even
    before they occur, helping to prevent major power outages. The LV Cloud
    application is deployed on the Microsoft Azure Cloud, which provides
    scalability and flexibility of the infrastructure.
    <br><br>
    Going into technological details, the LV Cloud has
    a <strong>microservices-based architecture</strong>
    and was deployed to Microsoft Azure using
    <strong>Kubernetes</strong>
    (an open-source container orchestration platform). We use Highcharts.js
    and Vue to maintain performance with big datasets. We also use Kafka
    and MQTT, two complementary technologies, for communication between
    microservices.
