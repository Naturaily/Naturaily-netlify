          is still loved by developers for its stable position and well-developed
          infrastructure. You can build many various great apps with Rails but when you need
          your app to be real-time and able to run on various devices, however, there’s a strong
          chance that Node.js should be your choice. The latter also outperforms RoR when it
          comes to stability and performance.

          A decision between Node.js vs PHP should be determined by the type of application
          you want to build and your hosting requirements. If your project is a real-time
          application, such as chat, a Single-page Application, or a collaboration app,
          you should go for Node.js. When you’re just looking for a standardized solution
          with considerable hosting support - PHP might be a better consideration.

          While Node.js will be the best match for building many applications, it is not
          suitable for any project. It is simply unnecessary for simple HTML apps where all
          the data comes from the server only. In cases like that, you should consider
          Ruby on Rails, a proven solution that will empower you to build a prototype in
          only hours.
          <br><br>
          Rails would also be a better choice for relational database server-side apps,
          as Node.js’s relational database tools are not that robust and easy to work
          with as Ruby’s.
