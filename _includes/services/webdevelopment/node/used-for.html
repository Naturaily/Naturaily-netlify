          Node.js is equipped with all the required functionality for building
          a real-time chat. With its powerful Event API, Node.js makes it easy
          to add server-side events and push notifications to your app. It also
          works well with WebSockets technology, which allows for faster data
          transfer, which is highly crucial for real-time applications.

          Node.js is known for its ability to process multiple requests
          and events from almost an endless number of devices on the network,
          which makes it perfect for IoT projects. Thanks to an event-driven
          architecture and asynchronous processing, it’s impossible for Node.js
          app’s servers to be blocked or slowed down by a huge amount of data
          and requests.

          An event-driven I/O makes Node.js one of the most efficient server-side
          frameworks. No matter how data-centered your tasks are, your app may
          load up to three times faster.

          Complex SPAs

        <p class="services-faq__text services-faq__text--hidden" data-content-index="3">
          Node.js is great for SPAs, as it’s written in JavaScript - the very
          same language that React, Angular, and many popular frameworks widely
          use in building Single Page Apps. As developers can use the same
          structures both on the server and client-side, developing SPAs
          in Node.js is much faster and easier to maintain.

          The asynchronous and event-based architecture of Node.js is great
          for collaboration apps - its Event API and WebSockets make sure
          that the server won’t hang and users will be able to work
          continuously. Node.js was used for the server-side of the
          project management app Trello.

          Node.js is a great choice for streaming services, like Netflix
          or YouTube, because of its native Stream API. Streams are a way
          to handle writing and reading files, network communications,
          or any kind of information exchange in an efficient way.
