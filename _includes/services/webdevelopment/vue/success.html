      LVCloud is an app for monitoring electricity grids. We combined new technologies, such
      as Machine Learning, with Vue.js for the frontend to create an IoT app that detects
      and solves issues with electricity networks.
      <br><br>
      If any threads for the grid appear, such as too high humidity or cables in a poor state,
      specialists can trace them in the app.
