      <p class="vue-what__intro">
        Vue.js is a JavaScript progressive framework for building web interfaces. What makes it
        stand out among other solutions is its adaptability and flexibility, which help you
        create various projects much faster, complete with great performance and&nbsp;reliability.

        The framework has been created by Google’s ex-developer, Evan You, whose goal was to take
        some features and concepts he enjoyed using from Angular and build a lightweight framework
        around them. What we now know as Vue.js launched less than a year after Facebook’s React
        and has been getting lots of credits from both developers and companies ever since.

        Vue.js has a rich ecosystem, which speeds up the process of starting a project.
        Its adaptable style and flexibility make it easy for your app to scale, no matter
        if you run a rapidly growing startup or a big company.
        <br><br>
        What’s more, Vue’s core team’s support makes it easy to integrate with numerous other
        libraries or existing projects you may have - Rails being an example. Vue is also
        a perfect solution for more advanced Single-Page Applications, when used with
        supporting libraries.
        <br><br>
        Vue’s code is actually very close to the original JavaScript code and uses original
        templating, resulting in simpler code that is easier to maintain.
