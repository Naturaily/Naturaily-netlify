          Vue.js is a great choice when you are looking for a lightweight, fast, and modern library
          to build single-page applications, as well as more complex apps, as they have a core-team
          supported routing and data storage solutions.
          <br><br>
          It is also used for building interactive web interfaces thanks to its small footprint as,
          compared to React, it’s easy to program a widget or create web components with.
          <br><br>
          Many JavaScript skeptics have started using Vue.js for its simplicity - the code looks
          almost like HTML when it’s really not. It’s composed of HTML templates, some reactive
          properties, and ways to organize your code (components, refs, computed properties,
          methods, and custom directives).
