          The React team is continuously improving their product. Even now, the library allows
          developers to efficiently create application components and reuse them in various
          slots of the project. This DRY approach pushes higher code quality while reducing
          the amount of required code, thus making the development process much faster.

          React.js, being a JavaScript library, has found its way onto many modern devices
          - it’s a very good solution for cross-platform applications. React offers a unique
          and very efficient way of updating the view as it can update separate components
          only when state changes are detected, making it a viable solution for SPAs and PWAs.

          With the right tools and developers, React.js applications can easily become
          SEO friendly. React offers server-side rendering, which returns the Virtual DOM
          to the client-side. As Google pushes fast website rendering times to maintain good
          SERP ranks, this feature ensures high SEO performance.

          React’s goal is to provide the best web rendering performance. Given the amount
          of utility and features React has, it is very performant compared to other similar
          solutions, with snappy applications and very low loading times guaranteed.
