        React was both created and later developed at Facebook. Since its launch in 2013,
        it has taken the JavaScript community by storm. It helps to build beautiful,
        interactive apps with an outstanding performance that gives users a native-like
        experience. React.js is still maintained by Facebook and has gained millions
        of developers and hundreds of contributors.

        React.js will help you build fast single-page applications or websites. It has a very
        simple API, which frees your application logic from being necessarily forced to rely
        on one framework. React.js also makes use of virtual DOM, making it easy to integrate
        it with any other app. Additionally it stands out with how SEO-friendly the pages are,
        particularly when compared to other JS libraries, thanks to JSX being adopted
        to structural components.
