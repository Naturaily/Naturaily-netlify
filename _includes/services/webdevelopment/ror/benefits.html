      With its simple and intuitive code, Ruby facilitates software development and saves time:
      on average, developers who use Ruby on Rails build applications 30-40% faster than teams
      that use other technologies. - Bruce Perens, one of the Open Source movement founders

          Imagine you could build an MVP in just a few weeks. Ruby on Rails was designed
          to do this. The web frameworkâ€™s rapid app development is possible because
          of the Convention over Configuration principle, which saves time spent on writing
          the code. Rails was designed to make developers follow certain standards, so it is
          very easy to add new engineers to the team or switch to a new project.
