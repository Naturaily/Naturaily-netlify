      With the art market evolving, Artinfo was seeking an opportunity to expand and improve
      service for their users. They decided to optimize the purchase process, which used
      to be held via email or phone. Using Ruby on Rails, we helped them create a combination
      of a news website, dedicated to the art market, with a sophisticated catalog of art
      pieces and auction houses, alongside the marketplace.
