      Electricity is a crucial part of todayâ€™s ecosystem. We used new technologies, such
      as Machine Learning, to create a complex app that can detect and solve problems
      with electricity networks immediately. The software we created detects any traces
      of malfunction or physical damage in the grid, such as too high humidity or cables
      in a poor state of repair.
