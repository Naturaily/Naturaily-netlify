            <strong>Flexibility:</strong>
            React is known for its component-based development, which lets
            developers reuse already written code and write small features.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Performance:</strong>
            React’s great advantage lies in how fast it performs in your app.
            It improves the user experience for your customers, as well as
            your conversions and SEO positioning, driving you more sales.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can easily integrate it with a backend platform like Node.js,
            keeping all the code in the JavaScript for easy maintenance.
