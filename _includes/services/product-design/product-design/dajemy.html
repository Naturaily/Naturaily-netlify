    Artinfo provides users and auction houses with an easy to use platform
    that enables real-time bidding. It is also an amazing base of news
    and information about Europeâ€™s art market.
    <br><br>
    With the art market evolving, Artinfo was seeking an opportunity
    to expand and improve the service for their users. We decided
    to optimize the purchase process, which used to be held via email
    or phone. This resulted in an increased number of customers
    interested in buying art online.
