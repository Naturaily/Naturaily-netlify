          Design thinking is an iterative process of creating new and
          innovative ideas that solve problems. It seeks to understand
          users, make and challenge assumptions, redefine problems and
          create break-through solutions to prototype and test.
          <br><br>
          The method consists of 5 phases:
          <ul class="services-faq__text-list">
            <li>Empathize</li>
            <li>Define</li>
            <li>Ideate</li>
            <li>Prototype</li>
            <li>Test</li>
          </ul>
          It is not limited to any specific industry - it can be
          effective in design, technology or education, as it may be
          in other services.

          Prototyping your future product or service before the launch
          of the final version has several advantages.
          <br><br>
          Making a prototype can highlight any conceptual or technical
          difficulties of the idea. Letting you test your product’s usability,
          navigation or information architecture also enhances the quality
          of your website or an app as a result.
          <br><br>
          One of the advantages of using prototypes is reducing the risk
          of the project, as compared to a project in which prototyping was
          not included. It also lets you better estimate the number of work
          hours and resources needed.
          <br><br>
          Finally, a prototype is a simulation of your future product, so
          it can help attract investors to your project before allocating
          any resources needed for implementation. Showing it to a bigger
          number of potential users will also provide you with a valuable
          feedback on your product’s usability.
