            This is the initial stage of the product design process that helps
            to define problems that the designed product may be a solution to.
            By asking some basic questions, like:
          </p>
          <ul class="product-design__switch-card__list">
            <li>what problem are we trying to solve?</li>

            <li>what do we want to accomplish?</li>

            we are getting closer to understanding the user experience of
            a product as a whole (not only its look & feel) and understanding
            the product's context for existence.
            <br><br>
            Based on that we can define the product vision, do the product
            research and make in-depth user analysis to identify all
            the market opportunities and threats - which smoothly leads
            us to the second stage.

            Business strategy is the foundation for the effective product
            design process. Before the development process begins
            it’s priceless to know if the product or service is really
            what people need.
            <br><br>
            The first reason for startup failure, according to CB Insights,
            is “no market needed” (42%). Next are run out of cash, not
            the right team, pricing issues or poor marketing. All of them
            can be eliminated by proper preparation = creating
            a business strategy.

            Knowing all the necessary basics like target group, users’ needs,
            users’ journeys and having all the useful tools such as sketches,
            wireframes, personas and surveys we can start the design phase.
            <br><br>
            The first part of the process is prototyping which helps
            to deliver a good user experience. It gives a chance
            to test an idea before building the full solution.
            The created prototype is then reviewed, refined and iterated.
            At the end of the prototyping phase, the design will
            be ready for production.
            <br><br>
            The next steps are testing and validating to make sure
            the design concept works as intended.

            The development phase is the final one. We start by choosing
            the right technologies, tools and workflow to achieve set goals.
            Depending on the requirements and project itself we can choose
            <a href="/services/webdevelopment/jamstack">Jamstack development</a>,
            <a href="/services/webdevelopment/pwa">PWA development</a>,
            <a href="/services/webdevelopment/ruby-on-rails-development">Ruby on Rails development</a>,
            <a href="/services/webdevelopment/react-js-development">React development</a>
            or other approaches. Then we set up the team of developers
            dedicated to your project and prepare the development schedule
            to make sure that the product will be ready just on time
            to conquer the market.
