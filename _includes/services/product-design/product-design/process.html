        When designing a product, we have to do it based on
        <span class="product-design__section-description--secondary">human nature</span>,
        not what we think is human nature. Reliable and properly
        interpreted data is the
        <span class="product-design__section-description--secondary">best basis in the design process</span>.

        An invaluable stage of this creative process is a five-day series of
        interactive workshops when we take the product from its initial design
        idea through to prototyping and user testing.
        <br><br>
        These few days of intensive work results in the knowledge base
        necessary to design the right product.
