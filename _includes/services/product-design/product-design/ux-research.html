        Research is a powerful tool for helping us identify and either prove
        or disprove our assumptions. It also helps us recognize the needs
        and goals of future users, as well as their mental model, consequently
        enabling us in creating better products and services.
        <br><br>
        There are many research methodologies available, from in-person
        interviews to unmoderated A/B tests. We choose the ones that turn
        out to be the most appropriate in a given situation to understand
        the ‘how’ and the ‘why’.
        <br><br>
        Thanks to UX research we can design with the end-user in mind.
