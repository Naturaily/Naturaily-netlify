## What Is Headless?

Headless may seem a complicated concept behind which lies an advanced technology. But in reality, the concept of "headless" is simple. It's **decoupling** (separating) **the front-end of your system from the back-end**. That allows you to create the architecture just the way you'd like it to be.

With "heads" (decoupled front-end) you can customize the front-end, make flexible changes to the themes, template, layout, pictures, and anything else your customer sees upon entering your site. The back-end, on the other hand, is like a core body. And your body can have as many different heads as necessary.

In other words, **in headless architecture**, you don't base your platform on one tool, but can freely use different technology for front-end and back-end to create a better user experience.

## Traditional Commerce vs Headless Commerce

Let's dive a bit deeper into traditional commerce and headless architectures. The difference between the two is simple and crucial if you're wondering which is better for your business.

### Traditional commerce

Traditional commerce is based on **monolithic architecture**. It means that there's one, unified model for the design of the platform. Traditional commerce is usually large and difficult to change. It's also based on a long, hard-to-maintain source code with a fixed framework.

The most important aspect of classic commerce is its back-end–front-end integration. The "head" is fixed—coupled—and you can't attach any other elements. In other words, the back-end is tightly connected to a preset front-end.

That gives you limited options of customization and may cause delayed innovation. It's heavily limited in delivery and layout options. Also, it may not always be possible to deliver the content to other means than a website or mobile app.

Such a framework is best for well-established businesses, personal websites with blogs and portfolios, and other similar content. Since they don’t require much intervention and digging in code, it'll be easier to maintain them.

One of the best examples of monolithic architecture is WordPress. It's an environment where you create all platforms within one platform. Although you can add extensions to make your experience more customizable, you're still limited by just one platform.

### Headless commerce

In contrast to traditional commerce/cms, **headless commerce**, as we've already mentioned, has **a duality function**. Its architecture allows you to create a fully customized, multi-layered environment to deliver a perfect website and do the tiniest tweaks at every level.

You can rip off the head and attach one, two, or as many as you want to build your perfect website.

In general, headless architecture lets you freely move around your commerce environment and look into every nook and cranny of your platform. It's lightweight and offers endless possibilities.

In short, traditional commerce means heavy, monolithic architecture while headless is an API-driven, developer-friendly environment.

## How Headless Works?

When using a headless process to create a website, you can divide it into two stages: preparing the content and customizing the design.

Here's how it looks like in a few steps:

1. **Store** — you enter the content into the database
2. **Manage** — you manage it, change, adjust, and customize
3. **Deliver** — you deliver the content to a chosen front-end, so here’s how it's going to look as a dynamic material. It's an easy way to change the layout without getting rid of content data. Here, you use APIs for transferring the data between the back-end and front-end.

Headless allows you to quickly deliver content and build a data repository, for example, for all the products you want to have in your e-store. That way, you don't have to focus on tiresome digging in the code.

## Why Is Headless Better Than Traditional Commerce?

Since e-commerce is a fast-growing, competitive niche, it requires innovative solutions. The headless approach helps to implement quick changes and boost growth.

Here are all the reasons for which headless is the right framework for e-commerce **from a technical point of view**.

### Full flexibility

Since back-end and front-end are decoupled, you decide what to do with the two.

When it comes to the back-end, your developers can choose their favorite framework so they can have a better user experience as admins.

The front-end enables devs to adapt the platform via APIs so they have all the right tools for the job.

Headless gives you a lot of flexibility, agility to discover new developing solutions, test new ideas and designs, and implement the latest trends. It's entirely up to you how you build the platform.

### Easier to maintain

In [headless e-commerce](https://naturaily.com/blog/next-js-commerce-vue-storefront-saleor-magento-pwa-studio-modern-headless-storefront-platforms-compared), there's no long code to dig around in, and no need to modify the databases that are located deep under different layers of code.

You can easily manage all your content, catalogs, data, inventory, and more in one place. You don't have to switch between different vendors, software, and systems.

Additionally, it's easier to spot and fix bugs and maintain continuity within the platform, the heads and the main body.

### Continuous development

One of the assumptions of the headless approach is to be able to use modern technology to provide a flexible environment for a website.

It's helpful in A/B testing to find out how customers behave and interact with the website to improve CX.

What's more, development teams responsible for back-end and front-end don't have to interrupt each other but can work more efficiently, and even collaborate better. **Smooth processes ensure fast innovation**, a quick and steady pace of change, and better adjustability to the customer needs of your e-commerce.

[Statistics](https://www.superoffice.com/blog/customer-experience-statistics/){:rel="nofollow"} show that **86%** of buyers are willing to pay more for a great customer experience. If you want to meet their needs, you need to be ready for change and innovation. And there's no better way to do it than to adopt headless.

### Improved developer experience

Headless is fully customizable not only from the side of user experience but also developer experience. Your IT team can choose which framework they want to work in, what tools to use, and what methodology suits them best.

You control how everything works and looks like as an admin and builder of the code. **You own the architecture.**

It makes work easier and more enjoyable. As a result, the end product is delivered faster, better, and in high quality.

### Better performance

The headless approach ensures **scalability and high performanc**e.

You don't have to worry when your site goes down or has some glitches. It's much easier to fix bugs and add patches when the back-end and front-end are separated.

Headless is focused on delivering fast results in the most convenient way.

### Integrated commerce experience

With headless e-commerce, you can customize the user experience for every stage of the buyer's journey. That way users engage more with the platform. Instead of separate links and references, you have **all the touch points smoothly integrated**.

That provides better adjustability to client's changing needs. And your developers can ensure an undisturbed buyer's journey, from beginning to end.

### Lower cost of maintenance

Headless is cheaper than traditional commerce. When you operate on separate pieces, it requires less engagement from fewer people. Especially, if you want to introduce smallish changes.

Additionally, when you use external APIs and third-party apps, you can **save money on some of the aspects of DevOps and maintenance of the servers**.

## Advantages & Disadvantages of Headless

Despite the fact, that headless offers possibilities for quick innovation and saves a lot of time and money, it has its flaws.

Let's look at the bigger picture and analyze all the pros and cons of headless e-commerce for you and the customers.

### Pros:

**+ Quick updates** — all changes are implemented with a blink of an eye on the contrary to sites built on classic architecture.

**+ Better user experience** — with a fully customizable front-end, you can create a perfect UX to attract more customers.

**+ Performance & fast loading pages** — headless supports fast delivery of websites so all changes happen quickly, thereby your site will load much faster. It's [widely known](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/google-53-of-mobile-users-abandon-sites-that-take-over-3-seconds-to-load/426070/){:rel="nofollow"} that if a page takes more than 3 or 4 seconds to load, the visitor will leave it. Headless prevents that from happening.

**+ The right tools** — the APIs allow you to add whatever you want with pre-built integrations. That gives the developers full control of how the end-product will look like but also what environment and framework they work within.

**+ Time to market** — with headless commerce, businesses can react quickly to changes.

**+ Automated touchpoints** — payment, shipping procedures, and other commerce processes can be easily automated for even better customer experience

**+ Higher security** — because the headless as a development ecosystem is less vulnerable to outside breaches, the safety of your website and client information is ensured.

**+ Better control** — the separation of back-end from front-end help to save time; you don't have to find lines of code, interfere with the databases. The management is much easier and straightforward.

**+ Easy content management** — simple to use admin for content editing, product management, and visual [e-commerce website design](https://naturaily.com/blog/how-to-pick-the-best-ecommerce-website-design-company).

**+ Omnichannel delivery** — multi-channel servicing is on the rise. People want to buy more and quicker via different channels. Headless allows you to deliver your site to any device connected to the web, be it a smartphone, smartwatch, laptop, or tablet.

**+ Staying ahead of competitors** — quick change, embracing innovation, tailored customer experience, high performance, and flexibility — you get it all when using headless technology. That helps you become a serious competitor for other brands from your niche.

**+ SEO-friendly** — Google and other web browsers like well-performing, fast, and secure pages. Headless gives you all these elements at once.

Cons:

**- Requires technical skills** — you need to have a front-end developer, or an entire team if you're building a large e-commerce site

**- Complex design** — if you're looking for a simple solution that doesn't require lots of customization and personalization, headless may not be right for your business.

**- Higher cost of dev teams** — in [e-commerce development](https://naturaily.com/services/ecommerce/custom-development), when building a complex platform with many features, you may need to hire many people. And the more developers you hire to build and maintain your system, the higher the costs.

**- More content to manage** — managing content with headless is a bit like adding another smaller piece to the puzzle. It gets bigger and requires more management.

Overall, the pros outweigh the cons. Using the API-driven architecture offers many more positive aspects than sticking to the classical, old-fashioned monolithic one.

## Conclusion

Without any doubt, headless is the future of e-commerce. Quick changing needs of customers and market trends will force businesses to reinvent their approaches.
