**Headless e-commerce becomes more popular. Since it gives you more flexibility and allows for a personalized user experience, it may be a good idea to switch from traditional commerce. Many [headless storefront platforms](https://naturaily.com/blog/next-js-commerce-vue-storefront-saleor-magento-pwa-studio-modern-headless-storefront-platforms-compared) embrace the possibilities offered by this technology.**

That's because customers are becoming more demanding and have higher needs. And you need to keep up with their expectations and changing trends on the market to grow your business. That’s what headless e-commerce can help you with.

**Here are the key takeaways you'll learn from this guide:**

4. Why headless is better than traditional e-commerce platforms

## What Is Headless?

Headless may seem a complicated concept behind which lies an advanced technology. But in reality, the concept of "headless" is simple. It's **decoupling** (separating) **the front-end of your system from the back-end**. That allows you to create the architecture just the way you'd like it to be.

With "heads" (decoupled front-end) you can customize the front-end, make flexible changes to the themes, template, layout, pictures, and anything else your customer sees upon entering your site. The back-end, on the other hand, is like a core body. And your body can have as many different heads as necessary.

In other words, **in headless architecture**, you don't base your platform on one tool, but can freely use different technology for front-end and back-end to create a better user experience.

## Traditional Commerce vs Headless Commerce

Let's dive a bit deeper into traditional commerce and headless architectures. The difference between the two is simple and crucial if you're wondering which is better for your business.

### Traditional commerce

Traditional commerce is based on **monolithic architecture**. It means that there's one, unified model for the design of the platform. Traditional commerce is usually large and difficult to change. It's also based on a long, hard-to-maintain source code with a fixed framework.

The most important aspect of classic commerce is its back-end–front-end integration. The "head" is fixed—coupled—and you can't attach any other elements. In other words, the back-end is tightly connected to a preset front-end.

That gives you limited options of customization and may cause delayed innovation. It's heavily limited in delivery and layout options. Also, it may not always be possible to deliver the content to other means than a website or mobile app.

Such a framework is best for well-established businesses, personal websites with blogs and portfolios, and other similar content. Since they don’t require much intervention and digging in code, it'll be easier to maintain them.

One of the best examples of monolithic architecture is WordPress. It's an environment where you create all platforms within one platform. Although you can add extensions to make your experience more customizable, you're still limited by just one platform.

### Headless commerce

In contrast to traditional commerce/cms, **headless commerce**, as we've already mentioned, has **a duality function**. Its architecture allows you to create a fully customized, multi-layered environment to deliver a perfect website and do the tiniest tweaks at every level.

You can rip off the head and attach one, two, or as many as you want to build your perfect website.

In general, headless architecture lets you freely move around your commerce environment and look into every nook and cranny of your platform. It's lightweight and offers endless possibilities.

In short, traditional commerce means heavy, monolithic architecture while headless is an API-driven, developer-friendly environment.

## How Headless Works?

When using a headless process to create a website, you can divide it into two stages: preparing the content and customizing the design.

Here's how it looks like in a few steps:

1. **Store** — you enter the content into the database
2. **Manage** — you manage it, change, adjust, and customize
3. **Deliver** — you deliver the content to a chosen front-end, so here’s how it's going to look as a dynamic material. It's an easy way to change the layout without getting rid of content data. Here, you use APIs for transferring the data between the back-end and front-end.

Headless allows you to quickly deliver content and build a data repository, for example, for all the products you want to have in your e-store. That way, you don't have to focus on tiresome digging in the code.

## Why Is Headless Better Than Traditional Commerce?

Since e-commerce is a fast-growing, competitive niche, it requires innovative solutions. The headless approach helps to implement quick changes and boost growth.

Here are all the reasons for which headless is the right framework for e-commerce **from a technical point of view**.

### Full flexibility

Since back-end and front-end are decoupled, you decide what to do with the two.

When it comes to the back-end, your developers can choose their favorite framework so they can have a better user experience as admins.

The front-end enables devs to adapt the platform via APIs so they have all the right tools for the job.

Headless gives you a lot of flexibility, agility to discover new developing solutions, test new ideas and designs, and implement the latest trends. It's entirely up to you how you build the platform.

### Easier to maintain

In [headless e-commerce](https://naturaily.com/blog/next-js-commerce-vue-storefront-saleor-magento-pwa-studio-modern-headless-storefront-platforms-compared), there's no long code to dig around in, and no need to modify the databases that are located deep under different layers of code.

You can easily manage all your content, catalogs, data, inventory, and more in one place. You don't have to switch between different vendors, software, and systems.

Additionally, it's easier to spot and fix bugs and maintain continuity within the platform, the heads and the main body.

### Continuous development

One of the assumptions of the headless approach is to be able to use modern technology to provide a flexible environment for a website.

It's helpful in A/B testing to find out how customers behave and interact with the website to improve CX.

What's more, development teams responsible for back-end and front-end don't have to interrupt each other but can work more efficiently, and even collaborate better. **Smooth processes ensure fast innovation**, a quick and steady pace of change, and better adjustability to the customer needs of your e-commerce.
