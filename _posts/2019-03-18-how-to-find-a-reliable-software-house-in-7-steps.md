## 1. Team’s background

One of the first steps you have to take while searching for a software house is checking the team’s background. How can you do that? There are multiple ways of finding and getting to know a software house. 

One of the obvious ones is Clutch.co. It holds detailed information about companies from all around the world. Each review has to be approved making sure that you won’t find hollow and fake companies. 

What is a team without experience? At Naturaily we have over **12 years of experience in building digital products**. It’s a healthy practice to check previous and current team’s clients, their reviews and built products.  Clutch is a great place to start. We recommend **asking them directly about the cooperation with the development team**. It’s important to keep the questions as brief as possible, ask them the most crucial questions - how was the communication, how well the company was meeting the goals and what is the company’s approach. 


## 2. Expertise

Hopefully, you will find there an idea that’s similar to yours. Look for a team that has the experience in the field your project is, although it’s not always necessary. In order to do this, you have to carefully **analyze the portfolio**. Let’s say that a company has successfully developed a grid monitoring system with machine learning capabilities. At first, it may not seem like much to you but what if we rephrase it into ‘big data analysis, Internet of Things, real-time grid monitoring with machine learning’? It makes quite a difference, right? Notice that **they mean the exact same thing**. 

Finding a software house with similar projects to your idea helps the company **understand your business goals** what, in the end, leads to **higher quality product**. 

What’s more important is the technological stack, especially when you’ve already decided what technology you want your project to be developed with. Find a software house that is using these frameworks, libraries or languages. They are typically listed under the ‘Services’ section on the software house’s website. 


## 3. Billing model

We recommend people who seek for digital solutions to get offers from as many software houses as possible for comparison purposes.  Typically, **estimations are free**. [button do ‘get an estimate’] What you will notice in some cases is a **significant price difference among offers**. While offering similar technological stack and solutions, cheaper companies tend to have a much longer estimated time-to-market compared to, initially seeming, expensive software houses. 

Let’s say that the company X offers 25$ per man-hour and company Y offers 75$ for the same project. Company X’s offer seems to be more appealing, but probably it will take much more time to deliver the product than company Y while keeping the end price exactly the same. Company Y works Agile, meaning that the team’s goal is to deliver the product as soon as possible. An agile approach has many perks - **transparent development, you pay only for the hours spent on the projects and actual results**. 

Once it’s delivered, you can finally monetize it (yay!). If you’d chosen Company X’s offer you would have to wait much longer for the same result. 

Companies often offer some sort of a **free trial** allowing clients to be confident in signing the final deal. If the expectations are not met you can terminate the cooperation but keep in mind that after doing so you lose all progress achieved by the team. At Naturaily, the trial usually lasts XXX weeks.  

## 4. Technological stack

Good software houses offer a wide variety of quality technologies to choose from. They don’t force their clients to use one and only technology but try to **tailor the tools specifically for your needs**. 

Make sure to choose actively developed and widely used tools. Some companies may want to develop new products using old technologies in order to make cuts on production costs. The issues here is that these technologies will soon become obsolete which can lead to multiple problems with future proofing and further scalability of the product. 

## 5. Complex service

An ideal scenario would be a software house with all the necessary talents already included. This way you wouldn't have to worry about hiring, for example, external UI/UX teams separately. Designers can cooperate with developers and participate at every stage of the development process which may not be possible if they were from separate teams. 

It’s worth noting that you shouldn’t expect one company to take care of everything - this is actually a bad sign if a single company agrees to all your demands. We’re talking design, marketing, graphics etc. Companies should know their limits, otherwise, it may lead to a bad final outcome.  

## 6. Communication

One of the major problems clients have is the difficulty in communication. It may be caused by a number of reasons, from significant time zone difference to lack of internal organization.

From our experience, communication between the Product Owner/client and the software house **was proven to be improved by using specialized tools such as time trackers** (Breeze or Jira) and **chat software** (Slack). Using them allows developers to be in direct contact with the client. It **minimizes any possible errors** as they can easily discuss their doubts or ideas. At Naturaily, we think that transparent communication is the key to success. We’re in touch with our clients at each and every step of development. It’s a solid practice that can save a lot of stress, time and money in the long run. 

## 7. Formal agreement

You have finally found a few software houses that meet your requirements. Now what? It’s totally understandable if you are hesitant towards sending your brief over to protect your Intellectual Property. Most software houses offer NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement). It restricts them from revealing confidential information to others. It provides you the security and protects you against copyright infringement over a specified timeframe. Reliable companies will sign this contract with no hesitation/issues. Avoid companies that shy away from signing it. Some offer it before you even make the first contact. [link do get an estimate]
