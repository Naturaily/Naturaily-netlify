**Did you know Leonardo DiCaprio uses JAMstack? And he’s not the only one!**

**Well, now that we’ve got your attention… we’ve previously talked about how great JAMstack is so it shouldn’t be a surprise that everyone’s using it, right? Of course, the answer is never that simple.**

Some businesses have different priorities that aren’t aligned with JAMstack development. However, those that have chosen this approach (Mr. DiCarpio included) are certainly showing great results that are worth highlighting.

## So, without further ado, here are 10 fantastic examples of JAMstack in action.

1. Peloton
2. Logger MTS
3. Louis Vuitton
4. Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation
5. TakeShape.io
6. Fabuwood
7. Right From Basics
8. Easyship
9. Ingmarson
10. JFK Terminal 4

If you want to know more about each of them - read on.

<br>

### Peloton

**Frontend / Generator:** React JS

**CMS:** Contentful

[Peloton](https://www.onepeloton.com/){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"} sells exercise bikes and treadmills packaged with home classes - depending on where you are in the world, you’ve probably caught one of their adverts. While their range isn’t the biggest, it nonetheless needs to impress.

Of course, it wouldn’t be on this list if it wasn’t using JAMstack! It’s smooth, it performs well and doesn’t buckle under pressure, what more could you want?

<br>

### Logger MTS

Frontend / Generator: Hugo

CMS: Netlify

Many people assume that “static” websites are devoid of any animation or other elements. Often, because they are generally considered as counterintuitive of our JAMstack goals. Fortunately, [Logger MTS](https://www.loggermts.pl/en/){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"} has a website that perfectly proves them wrong - so we had to include it here.

It’s smooth, it’s fast, and it’s still beautifully animated where needed. From a visual perspective, this is the ideal example of JAMstack development that compromises on next to nothing, but still gives all the benefits.

<br>

### Louis Vuitton

**Frontend / Generator:** VueJS

**CMS:** Akamai

We’re including this option because we both want to include examples of e-commerce sites running on JAMstack as well as a very well known name. [Louis Vuitton](https://us.louisvuitton.com/){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"} fits the bill perfectly here. Not only is it a luxury brand, but the overall design shows that static web pages can’t still have a flair or a sense of dynamism.

Above all else, the site is easy to use, performs well and has a quick and easy checkout process with no technology hurdles in sight. JAMstack in a nutshell.

<br>

### Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation

**Frontend/Generator:** TakeShape.io

**CMS:** Cloudflare (CDN) + TakeShape.io (Content Editor)

Leonardo DiCaprio? We hope that’s a name that got your attention. Well, specifically, we’re talking about the website for his personal charity - the [Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation](https://www.leonardodicaprio.org/){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"}. Still, the organization has a long history and has grown to rely on the JAMstack ecosystem for their web-based needs.

Here, we see yet another example of what can be achieved with JAMstack. It’s static, but not visually boring. It’s fast to load, smooth to experience and ticks all the boxes a website should.

<br>

### TakeShape.io

**Frontend / Generator:** TakeShape.io

**CMS:** TakeShape.io

It stands to reason that any service designed to work with JAMstack should use the technologies themselves, right? Well, we just looked at [TakeShape.io](https://www.takeshape.io/){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"} in the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, so let’s take a look at their site.

TakeShape is a small player in the JAMstack world with a focus on content delivery networks. That said, its website is built entirely with these principles in mind - it’s fast, loads well and doesn’t put a strain on web browsers for the loading. It’s a point well demonstrated.

<br>

### Fabuwood

**Frontend / Generator:** Metalsmith, Webpack

**CMS:** Netlify & Prismic.io

Louis Vuitton isn’t the only designer brand to get in on the JAMstack action. [Fabuwood](https://www.fabuwood.com/){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"} designs luxury kitchen cabinets from their base in New Jersey, USA. While their range might be small, their website certainly doesn’t pull any punches when it comes to content.

From regular blogs and updates to the ability to find dealers via postcode, or even entire sections for kitchen inspiration, the Fabuwood site is built to easily handle content updates, changes and additions. What’s more, it’s sleek design doesn’t shy away from animation or dynamism where needed, but still loads wonderfully.

<br>

### Right From Basics

**Frontend / Generator:** Hugo

**CMS:** Netlify

A learning platform with a strong tech-focus, we’re not surprised [Right From Basics](https://rightfrombasics.com/){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"} has chosen the JAMstack route - in fact, they even cover JAMstack as a topic!

However, Right from Basics is a little unique in that it focuses on Golang, as well as more popular web-languages such as Python. This is why they focus on Hugo, a site generator written in Go, rather than something like JavaScript ([where we would recommend Gatsby JS instead!](https://naturaily.com/blog/why-you-should-consider-gatsby-js-for-your-jamstack-website)). Nonetheless, we like it because it showcases the wider versatility of JAMstack and the options at your disposal.

<br>

### Easyship

**Frontend / Generator:** Nuxt.js

**CMS:** Cloudflare (CDN)

As a shipping platform, the [Easyship](https://www.easyship.com/){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"} website has to offer a lot for individual users once they log in. In this way, they’ve used JAMstack to keep the web portal fast and highly performant.

This is particularly noticeable when using various tools and calculators. By keeping as much content as static as possible, the more complex elements don’t impact the website as much as they normally would - the ease of loading has been immensely lifted.

<br>

### Ingmarson

**Frontend / Generator:** Gatsby

**CMS:** Netlify

A London fashion retailer, [Ingmarson](https://ingmarson.com/){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"} is one of many great examples of JAMstack development with ecommerce. The site runs everything from product listings and virtual baskets to the checkout process itself.

A combination of Gatsby and Netlify, it’s a site that knows how to use the best technology for user-friendly means.

<br>

### JFK Terminal 4

**Frontend / Generator:** Webpack

**CMS:** TakeShape.io

Finally, let’s end on a site that arguably sees the most traffic. JFK International Airport is one of the biggest and busiest aviation hubs in the world - so big, in fact, that each of its 6 terminals is treated independently enough that they have their own websites. Here, we’re looking at the website for [JFK Terminal 4](https://www.jfkt4.nyc/){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"}.

This site performs as great as you’d expect, but it’s also designed for regular content in mind. Not only is there a content section, including blogs, news and events, there’s also more dynamic content, such as terminal maps (arguably the slowest part, because it connects to an external site) and wider directories. It’s a site built to offer a lot and handle a lot of traffic at the same time.

## The best in JAMstack development

JAMstack developers, take note: great websites don’t need to come at a cost. The examples here reflect the broad range of what is possible. Neither scope or scale can prevent a JAMstack website from competing with the rest of the internet.

Through the correct use of content management systems, site generators and a focus on web friendly technology (hello, JavaScript, Markdown and HTML!), it’s very easy to get a great looking and functionally hyper-performant website out there.
