As a part of our [ongoing tour](https://naturaily.com/on-tour){:target="_blank"}, we’re pleased to announce that we will be attending the Japan IT Week this Spring! 


## Japan IT Week

**Japan IT Week** is a trade show where you can find all kinds of the latest Internet of Things and Machine to Machine systems and technology. The 28th Spring edition includes two expos. **We’re extremely excited to be an exhibitor during the [IoT / M2M Expo](https://www.japan-it-spring.jp/en-gb/about/iot.html){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"}**!

Come and say hi!

**Date:** 10 - 12 April 2019

**Location:** Booth No. 19 - 25!

Mid-spring Tokyo is a perfect time and place to learn the newest and hottest technologies, especially **IoT solutions** from hundreds of talented and creative teams that will be attending the Expo this edition! 

Get your ticket [here](https://contact.reedexpo.co.jp/expo/DDES/?lg=en&tp=inv&ec=DDES){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"} and learn about how you can implement IoT technology in agriculture, medicine, factories, and logistics, how network and sensors construction is done by the *professionals*. Also, you will have a chance to check out novelties in the field of RFID and recognition technologies.

## LVCloud

We will be presenting our own [IoT development](https://naturaily.com/project/lvcloud){:target="_blank"} case study - LVCloud. It's an application that monitors and takes care of the electrical grid. We have combined **latest IoT technologies** and tools with **Machine Learning** into a sophisticated app that solves problems with electric networks before anyone knew they existed. 

<br>

|You can learn more about LVCloud and our other projects in the [Portfolio](https://naturaily.com/portfolio){:target="_blank"} section on our website.|
