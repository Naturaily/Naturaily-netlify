A while back, I've had the pleasure of interviewing Maxime Rouve, the Project Manager at Collectivity. In this post we are going to take a deeper look at how Collectivity, Naturaily's client, improves the lives of African people by allowing experts to share their opinions on certain collaborative projects.

### Could you describe what Collectivity is about and what it does?

   **Answer:** We’re units in the _Institute of Tropical Medicine_, health economics to be precise. We have been involved for almost 8 years in a lot of knowledge management activities. My Chief of Units, Prof. Bruno Meessen, launched several “Communities of Practice” which are discussion groups about professional thematics (Health Financing).

   **So far we have over 7000 people registered**, in 4 big CoPs. We originated on already existing solutions like Google Groups. At one point we considered it more limited than what we actually wanted to do. It’s good to talk, but we wanted to do something more that just talk, we wanted to do something more concrete, things with these people full of potential, with these experts.

   At that point, the Collectivity project was born, funded by NORAD (Norwegian government cooperation agency) and in Consortium with a Belgian technologic start-up (Blue Square). As academics, our traditional role in ITM is to test, document, understand. We were not used to think in terms of “viability”, “business plan” or even “user experience”. But from the scratch, Collectivity differs of our other activities, as the platform is thinked of as a tool that should remain after the end of project life. We will see if Collectivity is viable in a couple of months. We don’t have business mentality in our minds. We just observe, try things and they to document it.

   So I finally come to Collectivity.

   Collectivity is a platform where people, so far, from public health, Globalhealth and world of international cooperation can join and can dedicate time to communities, or activities. **One of our main principles is that we encourage people to contribute to activities in voluntary basis.**

   This concept is really interesting because it is not so obvious that people want to work for free, but there are specific activities where people really like what they are doing and are happy to share some expertise and experience.

   **_Collectivity is a platform where an expert can join, talk and eventually contribute to activities._**

### Could you briefly tell us the evolution of Collectivity since its launch?

   **Answer:** We released it in November 2016. At that time there were 60 registered users, who were our beta testers, colleagues and friends. Now, we are at around 2000 experts. For us, it is a nice success, just looking at this number. There are lots of challenges, because obviously we don’t have 2000 active users. But so far we have around 300 people who actively contribute to projects. Community is a quite new feature, because we released it last October.

### What were you doing to promote the platform? How did you manage to gain users?

   **Answer:** Before Collectivity, we managed Google Groups with thousands of users for several years. We tried to make active users of these groups to join it. We also have some voice in the sector because we presented the project in the marketplace of several conferences. Our unit has a strong network - it is recognized and has an influence in fields such as health financing, health policies in developing countries.

   In our sector we need to regularly answer call for proposals and we always integrate Collectivity in these calls. It means that it became a tool that we are using and encouraging our partners to use.

   Now, we are not contacting specifically people, people join through word of mouth.
   We had a transact release last month, several big institutions like **World Health Organisation** or **UNICEF**, decided to test the platform and to launch a community or an activity. So we see registration of people we don’t know. And people are attracted by these activities. It’s an organic growth now.

### What was the development process of the platform like?

   **Answer:** We were initially founded by the Norwegian government for 3 years. Initially it was planned to develop the platform from scratch with one development team/technical partner “Bluesquare”.

   We realised with BlueSquare that it would be better to externalise the development, so we gave an update to develop the platform.

   We developed it starting from Minimal Viable Product. We add features little by little, according to what people want, what partners want, what we want.

### What made you assume that there is a space for an organization like yours among others trying to solve similar problems?

   **Answer:** I think it’s an interesting question actually. The “Academic Wall” - it has some qualities, but it also has some limits. The thing is, in general, in our sector, there is a big unbalance between the expertise and there is a lot of silos*.

   For example, academics in the North \[share knowledge] between them. They don’t really communicate well with policy maker, they don’t really communicate well with the experts on the fields while also knowledge, practical knowledge. So the idea behind the communities of practise and Collectivity is to break silos, to bring people in the same place, where they can exchange knowledge and eventually work better on very concrete solutions.

   That ambition in practise, in our activities, it can be a really simple task, a so called “flash in the pan”. You can be like “Hey, I have time to organise, to develop a workshop in my country”. For the moment there are lots of little tasks like this. But our ambition is to develop, like we already did, “action research project” including several expertise from several countries. It can be a tool to organise, to structurate our ideas to break silos, to give voice to the experts of the South. If you look at Collectivity, we have a huge part of people from Africa, but we also try to develop it in southwest Asia.

   It’s more difficult for them globally to give voice to others, so these people on the platform have more opportunities. And what is also interesting big organisations in the North, like World Health Organisation, are totally lost in the actual system. If they want to collect data they will pay huge amount of money to an expert from the North who will go for 2 weeks to a country, do a random job and come back with data.

   More and more big north organisations want to take into an account the voice and expertise of the experts in the South. So actually these are 2 different type of people, but they have very convergent needs so we try to encourage and help them to communicate and walk together on Collectivity and our discussion group.

   _\* SILOS - a system that operates in isolation from others._

### What were the challenges in the early stages of Collectivity? What are the main challenges now?

   **Answer:** We are not used to work in this way. We are people who write papers, who go on the field to collect data, we are not really into entrepreneurship, we are not from technological world, even if we are really interested in it.
   So the first challenge for the team was to learn the startup meta, to make a business plan, because we intend to convert Collectivity into something viable; to walk in a different process, by fast learning circles - we learn actually to change our patterns, to be adaptable.

   One of the challenges was to communicate with the devs. During the early stages it was difficult, now I think it is going smoothly and naturally, but the first year was difficult.

   We have different conceptions of science and of what is our mandate as researches. There are people who think in terms of paper published and there are people like in our unit who are more interested in the impact, concrete actions. So it’s also a challenge to us to communicate with them, to make us understood.

   **Challenges for the future:**

   There are 2 main challenges for the future. The first one is to find money / make the platform viable and the second one is to convince institutions to join the platform on the more regular basis.

### So you have plans for monetizing system?

   **Answer:** It’s not yet sure because, let’s say, we are currently inside ITM, we are funded by public money of Norway.

   We will see, but if we want to have Collectivity still alive after the time of the project, we obviously need to think about the way to make it a viable and the solution can be to create some strategic value for big institutions or engineers for them, to show them institution value so they could be interested in contributing in the platform.

### What Does Success Look Like for Collectivity?

   **Answer:** Collectivity will be successful if it will continue to attract people,  if it will continue to attract active people. We will be very successful if we manage to have a sufficient pipeline of activities, and activities that produce a concrete impact, and by activities, I mean significant activities. 

   Eventually, the ultimate success for Collectivity could be not being limited just to public health but also to extend the concept to other sectors.

### What’s the current growth like? What are your plans for the future of Collectivity?

   **Answer:** We are around 2000 people, around 300 users contributed in various activities, we are around  900-1000 people who completed a profile, it is a first sign of an activity for us. 2000 registered and 300 who really contributed last year.

   An important thing that we like it’s not just number of people, but it’s also where they come from. We have people from 90 different countries. **It’s what we are aiming for - to exchange expertise around the world.**

### Who is your biggest competitor? Are there any other solutions similar to yours? How does Collectivity stand out?

   **Answer:** The difference is in our sector. The fact that we place and release expertise from both South and Center is not so common. So far, I think we are good at mobilizing and reaching these people because we’ve worked with them for years. There are several of the initiatives, launched by big institutions that may have more chance of success. In practise no one joins their platform and contribute actively to the activities. So, so far, what makes the difference is we have more legitimacy than lots of other initiatives because we work for 4 years in this logic.

### What are the plans for the future?

   **Answer:** We have several ideas to improve. We would like to add some basic mechanisms that we had developed in the first year, but were not optimal to simplify the user experience. After that we would like to add some new features, but it is not yet particularly clear.
