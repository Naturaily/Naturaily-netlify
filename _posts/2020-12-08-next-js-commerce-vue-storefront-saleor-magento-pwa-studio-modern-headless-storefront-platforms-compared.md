**The headless e-commerce trend has been gaining traction recently and PWA e-commerce frontends are slowly becoming the industry standard. According to Gartner, 80 percent of digital experience platforms will be deployed via headless by 2022.**

By leveraging the benefits of headless architecture, retailers can build online stores using independent frontends on top of e-commerce backends like Magento or Shopify. This design yields many benefits: the stores run faster, have higher conversion rates and rank higher in search results. 

Of course, you can always build your own PWA storefront from scratch. But the good news is you don’t really have to. The popularity of headless architecture has resulted in the emergence of many off-the-shelf e-commerce offerings. There is a thriving market of open-source storefronts. Some of them are compatible with multiple e-commerce platforms, while others are developed only with particular ones in mind – [Gatsby Storefront](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbystorefront/gatsby-starter-storefront-shopify/){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"}, for example, comes with a dedicated theme for Shopify.
