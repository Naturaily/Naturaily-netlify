title: Multiprocessing in Ruby - a Good Alternative to Threads?
description: >-
  Inspired by Python’s multiprocessing module I began to think about the  
  parallelism in Ruby. Of course, there are several ways to get closer, but in  
  this post I’ll try to focus on the “Process” class.

  Parallel computing is a cure for performance issues. It allows to do several
    things at once, which sounds great in the context of background jobs. Inspired
    by Python’s multiprocessing module I began to think about the parallelism in
    Ruby. Of course, there are several ways to get closer, but in this post I’ll
    try to focus on the `Process` class. But before we start, I recommend that you
    quickly recall the differences between a process and a thread.
