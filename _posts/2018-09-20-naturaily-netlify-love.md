## Naturaily and Netlify, love at first sight?



Is love at first sight even a thing? I believe it is! Our new site is a child of that love. Some time ago we thought that itâ€™s time for a change and started working on new site it was kind of a painful process but finally we made it, we went for static site and used Jekyll for that as we wanted blazing fast working site and the came a question of where to host it. So after a short search we came across Netlify and guess what? It was a love at first sight, let me tell you why.
