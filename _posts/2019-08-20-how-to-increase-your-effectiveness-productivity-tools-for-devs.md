Everyone is about productivity nowadays and preacher-like people just can’t stop preaching. Coaches, “influencers” (and that’s supposed to be a thing) talk all day about how certain systems, tools and mindsets will help you achieve your dreams.

Well, let me preach the same thing to you today. I am by no means an expert on this topic but I feel it’s only for the better. I want to show you battle tested techniques and tools that allow me to get things done. I will divide this article into parts addressing these questions:

1. **Where to get knowledge from?**
2. **How do I start organising my work?**
3. **Which tools should I use?**
4. **How to use these tools?**

Remember, although I am specifically addressing people from IT, I found that these are really useful for other types of intellectual workers out there.

## Where to get knowledge from?

We need some sources of knowledge to start with. There are a multitude of different books, manuals, scripts and youtube tutorials that claim they have “THE ULTIMATE PRODUCTIVITY HACK”. 

Spoiler alert: they don’t. 

It really boils down to you. If something doesn’t stick to your personality, it will not work. That’s it. What you need are tools to experiment with. Give them a try and see if you’re better at delivering what you supposed to deliver. Although it will be challenging at times, you will find great joy in finally nailing the right process for thought collection, processing and refining.

The first place on my list is a Youtuber, namely: [Thomas Frank](https://www.youtube.com/user/electrickeye91){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"}. For me, he is a great source for tips and even entire plans for, well, pretty much everything related to work. He has videos about productivity and how to actually use the advice he gives you, with titles like:

* How to USE Productivity Advice (Instead of Just Consuming It)
* How to Get More Done and Waste Less Time
* 5 Lessons from "The Productivity Project" by Chris Bailey

These short videos are not enough to get you started with making your life more productive but **Thomas always quotes scientific literature and gets his sources right**.

The second item on the list is David’s Allen book [“Getting Things Done”](https://gettingthingsdone.com/){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"}. This piece introduces a coherent system for managing all the tasks that come to your head every day, which could have an external as well as an internal source (External: the boss is asking you to do something; Internal: you want to buy a new microwave). To summarise Allen’s idea, you will need a few lists for ideas that will reduce the load required on your brain.

I reserved the third place for a book that is a bit more specific. Cal’s Newport “[Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692)[”](https://gettingthingsdone.com/){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"} defines a guide for how one should proceed in planning everyday’s work. We live in a world of constant distractions, like social media apps (Messenger and Instagram to name two of the long list). We have our deadlines, projects, asap’s and f\*\**ups. There is a lot to process from e-mails, Slack messages, advertisements and so on. We need a framework for controlling them and focusing on what is important: **our work**.

The last one is more about building habits that will help you stay on the right path. James’s Clear “[Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299)[”](https://gettingthingsdone.com/){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"} is a book about small, yet incredibly effective changes in everyday life that allows you to enjoy a “snow-ball” effect of cumulative upgrades. It takes time to get it right but just stick to it and you will see how you’re better every day in **what you want to do**.

## How do I start organising my work?

Start small. **REALLY SMALL**. Start by implementing one thing at a time. Are you bad at managing your Slack messages? Are you losing track of your work every day because something is interrupting you? Try to get every topic that is thrown at you into an inbox. By that I mean a place to just get everything into one place. Don’t get intimidated by others. It’s really simple: **you either have time to think on the given task or it isn’t doable**.

Reserve some time to review it and sort it. Some things may be unimportant and should be dropped immediately. A good way for doing it is the **Eisenhower method/matrix**:

| Types of task | Urgent   | Not urgent |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Important     | DO!      | Decide     |
| Unimportant   | Delegate | Delete     |

This matrix maps actions to types of tasks. As you can see we have two types of importance: something is either **important or it is not**, and two types of urgency: it’s either **urgent or not**.

With that in mind, we can now apply this mapping and take action. If a task is **Important and Urgent** then we should **do it immediately**. Example: the production server faces a few problems and they need to be addressed immediately.

If a task is **Important but not Urgent** then we can **decide how to approach it**. Example: There is a bug that messes up the data but it is not that frequent.

If a task is **Urgent but not Important** then we could try to **delegate it to someone else**. 
Example: we need to create a CRUD admin page which isn’t that important. We can delegate it to a Junior Developer.

If the task is either **Unimportant nor Urgent** we should **delete it out of our list of tasks**.

## Which tools should I use?

A great tool for managing our daily tasks is an app called [Nozbe](https://nozbe.com/pl/){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"}. It introduces the concepts found in Allen’s book which I mentioned before. It has all the tutorials, tips and hints you need to get you started. While it is quite challenging at first to comprehend all of the functionalities, there is no need to get it right at the first time. As I said (and will repeat it over and over again), **you don’t have to be an expert from the start**. Just do it, learn from your mistakes and be a bit better every day. It comes with a lot of handy integrations. You can connect your Nozbe profile with your Google Drive and Calendar, Evernote, Dropbox, Box and OneDrive accounts. There are a ton of possibilities to choose from. I am currently using it with Evernote.

So, the next productivity application that I use is [Evernote](https://evernote.com/intl/pl/){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"}. It’s a cloud-based noting system that allows you to have all of your notes available on a multitude of devices. The question is: what’s the difference between it and eg. Apple’s Notes app? First is the one I mentioned already - it has a lot of available integrations. Second is the plethora of auxiliary functionalities like image scanning for notes. Eg. you found something important in a book and need to take notes with a quote. **Take a picture with your phone and add it to your notes.** This greatly increased my ability to create coherent notes with a real reference to a specific page of a book I read.

The last one comes with no surprise (or at least it shouldn’t). Google has a vast selection of tools for almost everything. Creating documents, presentations or drawings was never so easy. Google Spreadsheets allow you to track expenses, Docs provide one of the best tools to create project documents that you can immediately share with others. That’s all true but there is one gem of an application that blew me away: [Google Drawings](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1LMVqfLLd8VmETnJvr9Imm9IfTEGVrq6eFE7SrLXcjfY/edit){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"}. It has one of the simplest ways of creating project outlines, database schemas and storing event-storming sessions results.

## How to use these tools?

### Tasks

Knowing what and how to use it doesn’t fulfil the indirect promise I gave at the beginning of this article. The experience I got from using the above tools will hopefully allow me to show you how to start ordering the mess we call “everyday grind”. Let’s start with Nozbe.

The sidebar, which is the main way of traversing through the app, has all the necessary references. In the beginning, there are only 4 buttons you should focus on:

1. **Priority**
2. **Inbox**
3. **Categories**
4. **Calendar**

![Nozbe](/assets/images/nozbe_1.png)

Adding a new task is simple. Every view has a big “+” sign in the lower right corner (desktop apps have handy keyboard shortcuts).

![Nozbe](/assets/images/nozbe_2.png)

After pressing it, a new field will appear at the top of the selected view:

![Nozbe](/assets/images/nozbe_3.png)

Now, you can start typing in your task or an idea. You can even add hashtags that will help you organise yourself.

![Nozbe](/assets/images/nozbe_4.png)

You most probably noticed the hashtag “Tomorrow”. Nozbe has a sophisticated system of tags that you can add to every task. You can assign dates with time, tags, projects and priority to every new entry. After confirming it, a new task will be created and will get on top of the list:

![Nozbe](/assets/images/nozbe_5.png)

Let’s try another one with a different date:

![Nozbe](/assets/images/nozbe_6.png)

And after you confirm it:

![Nozbe](/assets/images/nozbe_7.png)

The tool is making organising yourself easy. Even if you sometimes forget about it, having this app at hand will make you add tasks. At least some of them, which seems not much but having some of your daily goals written down is far better than none at all.

These are the basics of personal task management, of course. I wouldn’t even dare to call myself an expert and firmly believe that it all depends on how you, as the user, see it.

### Notes

While managing tasks is fine and dandy, the first problem occurred when there was a need for note taking. While Google Docs are really powerful, with a multitude of different functionalities, it’s too much for simple note taking. It’s designed like Microsoft Word software which is made for office-type jobs. Traversing through a document on a small screen is a painful experience.

The main benefit in my opinion, aside from the simplicity, is the tag system which is lacking in Google Docs. Also, simple notebooks where you just add new notes. It’s a simple, straight-to-the-point tool.

Let’s start with the menu. They are pretty much self-explanatory:

1. **Shortcuts** - Every note or notebook that is essential to everyday work
2. **All Notes** - All your notes
3. **Notebooks** - All your notebooks
4. **Shared with Me** - Everything shared with you by other people
5. **Tags** - All your tags
6. **Trash** - recently deleted notes

![Notes](/assets/images/notes_1.png)

Let’s click the **New Note** button. A new Note has been created. There is always a default notebook chosen. Now you can change it, add some tags, add a title and, as the tip suggests, start writing, drag files, or choose a Template for your note.

![Notes](/assets/images/notes_2.png)

I will fill it up with some text, to present some of the cool features a real notebook should have:

![Notes](/assets/images/notes_3.png)

It’s automatically saved in the cloud and it’s available on every device you installed the Evernote app.

Every note finds its way to an actual notebook, so let’s explore that part of Evernote:

![Notes](/assets/images/notes_4.png)

These are all your notebooks, which you can manage from here. You can add a new one, change the name or delete them if you wish so. Remember, removing a notebook removes all the associated notes as well. You can still retrieve them from **Trash**.

**Hint:** _Sometimes you have multiple notebooks for one general topic and few subdomains. As you can see, I already created one with the name programming/knowledge_base. It is really helpful to move around notebooks like that because it helps you organise a plethora of topics under a single prefix._

After double-click on a notebook takes you to the Notes browser where you can see all the notes associated with the selected notebook.

![Evernote](/assets/images/notes_5.png)

Now, the best part: integrating Evernote with Nozbe. It’s an easy process you can do. In your Nozbe app go to _Settings > Integrations > Evernote_:

![Evernote](/assets/images/notes_6.png)

![Evernote](/assets/images/notes_7.png)

![Evernote](/assets/images/notes_8.png)

Click the green button _“Connect your Evernote account with Nozbe”_. Follow the instructions on the site. After successfully connecting the apps, get back to Nozbe and hit _File > Sync_ (CMD + s on iOS). The green button will turn red.

![Evernote](/assets/images/notes_9.png)

What did it give me? Well, let’s imagine you have a note that is a part of something you need to do. Let’s add a task in Nozbe. Then click on it in the **Inbox**.

![Evernote](/assets/images/notes_10.png)

After clicking the _“Add comment”_ section, you will see a new view where you can add the comment, or… an Evernote note!

![Evernote](/assets/images/notes_11.png)

Now, click the dropdown menu with _“Text”_ text. You will see a few options with the Evernote one as well.

![Evernote](/assets/images/notes_12.png)

After clicking it, you will get a filtered list of all the notes you have on your Evernote account. 

![Evernote](/assets/images/notes_13.png)

Pick what you need. **You can select multiple notes!**

![Evernote](/assets/images/notes_14.png)

After clicking the _“Save”_ button, you can see all the notes in the form of a comment with references to every note used:

![Evernote](/assets/images/notes_15.png)

After clicking one of them, a window will appear with the full note:

![Notes](/assets/images/notes_16.png)

Isn’t that great? Now you can take quick notes and manage them properly, but also use them in your Nozbe task management system. This is especially useful if you have multiple meetings in one day. At the end of the day, you can summarize them, create tasks with actions from notes and attach notes to every task without the need to shuffle all those browser tabs.

### Drawings

The last thing that we need in our information management system are drawings. It sometimes isn’t good to just take a picture with your phone and share it on your Slack. We often need something editable and accessible by people working remotely. A whiteboard in your conference room just doesn’t fit this description for an efficient tool. Let’s face it, remote work isn’t the most convenient one and it’s a shame that no one has solved that problem yet… unless they did. I present to you the underdog, hidden under a submenu of Google Drive, an older cousin of Draw.io: **Google Drawings**.

![Google Drawings](/assets/images/drawings_1.png)

You have everything in here you need for brain and event storming sessions, simple database schemas and so on. You can even create some basic templates for your views. 

Don’t believe me? Look:

![Google Drawings](/assets/images/drawings_2.png)

Think, how much time is wasted before you can sync the business requirements with the design and the developers’ reality? Now, before an actual designer will start working on the app, you can solve a lot of user flow issues just by trying out different things in here. You can save a whole event storming session with ease. It’s all in the cloud so there is unlimited space for it.

## Summary

Using tools is necessary for us to be more productive as well as more effective. It isn’t about a tool in general, but the right one. It’s hard to get them right. Nature of our job changes constantly. Developers, managers, HR people, bosses or employees. I think that it isn’t hard to look for them but to start looking. I believe that the toolset above will give you a decent start on the path to better productivity.

To sum it up, have a tool/system for managing your:

* Tasks
* Text notes
* Visual notes

I hope this will help you get a head start on the road to great results like met deadlines, f\*\**ups avoided and chaos organised.

Farewell
