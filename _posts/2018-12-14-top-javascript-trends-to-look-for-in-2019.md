According Stack Overflow Report, JavaScript is one of the most popular languages for software development for many years and we predict it’s not going to lose its position any time soon (thank you Captain Obvious - right?). 

JavaScript frameworks and libraries listed below are usually the top choice for developers of web and mobile applications. What’s so special about JavaScript that is has become the top programming language these days? There are a few reasons for it. One of them i that frontend developers that are familliar with JavaScript can build backend applications with the lanugage they already know.

JavaScript development is changing rapidly. 2018 was a year with a lot of action, changes and new initiatives in front-end web development. The race to become the preferred JavaScript framework has heated up, as more projects have started to choose to switch from one framework to another (such as 9GAG that has switched from React to Vue).

If you are a startup or a small business, it is worth taking a look at all the new trends that have emerged over the past year. These new frameworks and integrations could be the key to putting your foot in the door of new innovative projects.

Let’s take a look at the major trends in JavaScript so you are up to date and ahead of the game:

## The rise of Vue.js

Despite being relatively new, the Vue.js framework is growing more and more popular everyday. Just last month it’s been downloaded over **2.4 million times**. Last year it received the highest amount of stars on GitHub out of all JavaScript projects out there, demonstrating how much developers enjoy and appreciate it.

Programmers familiar with other JavaScript frameworks can pick up Vue very easily due to its simplicity and clarity. Experienced developers that start working with Vue find its structure very intuitive as the Vue components are pretty much a combination of HTML and JavaScript. It has been learning from the mistakes and successes of React & Angular and only taking the best, while leaving the bad parts behind. The fact that Vue creators are constantly working on native TypeScript support(rumored to be ready in 2019) is just a cherry on top.

“_I can’t wait for the newest Vue (3) version and if what its creator - Evan You, is [saying](https://medium.com/the-vue-point/plans-for-the-next-iteration-of-vue-js-777ffea6fabf){:rel=nofollow} is true they’re going to hit a homerun and surpass other frameworks._” said one of our front-end developers Bartosz Zienkiewicz.

##  Not giving up the throne just yet - ReactJS

Supported by Facebook, React has been the most popular JavaScript frameworks over the past 5 years. Netflix, Flipboard, PayPal and BBC were the first organizations that utilized React’s potential. 

It is ideal for building large web applications that require changes over time without reloading the page.
According to their own [website](https://reactjs.org){:rel=nofollow} _React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes._

Due to its popularity and established position (mostly because of support from such giant as Facebook) it is not likely it will give up its spot at the top in the coming years.

## From AngularJS to Angular 7

A few years ago, Google initiated Angular, a framework that is a visionary of future changes in web APIs and is receptive to it. Angular.js is a trendy open-source front-end development framework which is largely utilized for developing useful dynamic single-page applications on the web. After learning from their experience in Angular 1, they created Angular 2 through 7 and achieved a great improvement.

There’s a big number of certified developers and a big community that allows you to create the right product to meet your business goals. **However** it is already being surpassed by forementioned Vue when it comes to popularity.

## The backend of Node.js 

The list of javascript frameworks is incomplete without mentioning Node.js. It is the most largely downloaded open source and cross-platform in the runtime environment for implementing JavaScript code exterior to a browser. It is utilized for developing server-side and networking applications with back-end services along with APIs. It is built on Google Chrome’s JavaScript Engine (V8 Engine) as a platform. 

**Node.js is the most popular JavaScript framework** when it comes to back-end and it’s not likely that this is going to change. This is the right choice for those who need a full-featured JS environment with access to all tools. 

## Worth mentioning - GraphQL

Many consider that GraphQL is the replacement for the REST APIs in 2019. However, REST and GraphQL do not necessarily have to be competitors, and one is not better than the other for all applications.

GraphQL is a query language that allows developers to make more specific requests from the server and package these requests in a simple way. GraphQL integrates with React through the Relay framework. It is an important trend for server requests and JavaScript APIs to advance, and it is another language that is worth trying.

“_In my opinion GraphQL, might be the feature to look out for in 2019. As seen based on npm downloads, more and more developers tend to use it in their projects. Its power comes from the fact, that GraphQL allows client to fetch only the data that it wants, and that means no more over or under-fetching!_” - Andrzej Gatkowski, intern at Naturaily.

## Conclusion

Momentum is currently behind React, and other libraries are moving in a similar technical direction. It’s a safe career choice but you should also consider Vue.js since its rise in popularity is steady and fast. It has already passed Angular, but to be fair this framework still has some adamant followers and specific uses.


When it comes to backend frameworks written in JavaScript, Node still has no competition, but look out for GraphQL - it might surprise you in the future!
