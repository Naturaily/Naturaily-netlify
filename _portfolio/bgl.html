  Baugenossenschaft Letten (BGL) is a&nbsp;Zurich housing cooperative. It comprises of
  607&nbsp;apartments, spread over 6&nbsp;settlements in the city of Zurich. 
  <strong>It was founded on February&nbsp;16, 1922</strong>, as a&nbsp;building cooperative
  by state, city and private employees of Zurich and renamed in&nbsp;1973. The current name
  refers to the district of Letten, where the first settlement of the cooperative was built.

  The company plays a&nbsp;very important role in bringing the local community together
  and makes every effort to ensure that each tenant feels at&nbsp;home. The website serves
  not only as an&nbsp;image function, but also provides residents with the most important
  information about BGL, its mission, the residential development and the people behind
  the building cooperative.

goal-step: Goal
goal-header: What the client wanted to achieve
goal-column-left: >-
  2022 is a&nbsp;very important year for BGL, as the company is celebrating its 100th anniversary.
  They decided to honor this with a&nbsp;new website, which will show that a&nbsp;company can be
  traditional and modern at the same time. <strong>BGL wanted it to be fresh, intuitive,
  <span class="non-breaking">easy-to-navigate</span> and, most importantly, informative</strong>.
  <br><br>
  From the practical point of view, there was also a&nbsp;need to give the content team the ability
  to edit the website content and rearrange the layout on their own. BGL wanted to be independent
  from external providers and <strong>be able to make necessary updates whenever they want</strong>. 
goal-column-right: >-
  Since it’s 2021, SEO optimization was a&nbsp;must, alongside <strong>excellent user experience
  and memorable design</strong>.
  <br><br>
  The previous website was developed over 10 years ago. While part of the information was updated
  throughout this period, <strong>the UI itself has never received an&nbsp;update until now</strong>.
  This also goes for all other assets unrelated to the website. With the anniversary approaching, 
  BGL aimed to improve their communication all-round. This included a&nbsp;brand new,
  <span class="non-breaking">state-of-the-art</span> website, new film and photo content,
  and revised documents for print (brochures, etc.).

challenge-step: Challenge
challenge-header: What we had to face
challenge-column-left: >-
  Our first step was a&nbsp;<strong>detailed analysis of the Storyblok CMS</strong>. Knowing that
  it’s in the initial phase of development and the documentation is misleading in some parts
  – we had to know all of its capabilities and limitations.
  <br><br>
  As soon as we received all the necessary assets, such as the content, images, videos
  and documentation, we started the development process. We worked on a completely new website,
  so we could do all the steps by the book.
challenge-column-right: >-
  The only "challenge" we had to face was to complete the project on time. We estimated that
  the work would take approximately 200&nbsp;working hours and that was exactly what it took
  to finish off the new BGL’ website. It was a&nbsp;one-man project and our <strong>Jamstack
  developer coped with this perfectly.</strong>
  <br><br>
  One of the most demanding tasks was to implement both an SSG (Static-Site Generator) and SSR
  (Server Side Rendering) scripting at the same time to reach different goals simultaneously.
