step-one-title: Art auction house
step-one-text: >-
  Artinfo is a web platform that offers not only a sophisticated catalog of art
  pieces and auction houses but also it is an amazing source of information
  about the art market in Poland and Europe. It has launched over 18 years ago. 
  With constant changes in the market, Artinfo was seeking an opportunity to
  expand and improve their service with new features and functionalities. 
  Artinfo used to receive bids via email or phone. This is why the
  implementation of online live auctions was Artinfo's and our primary focus -
  it significantly changes the way the company operates, for the better of
  course!

step-two-text: >-
  Artinfo provides auction houses with an easy to use platform for handling
  online real-time bidding during auctions.  Artinfo is a broker between auction
  houses and the customers for which they provide access to the online live
  auctions. Clients no longer have to be physically in the house in order to
  make a bid - with the help of Naturaily, now they can do it remotely.  This
  real-time web application is an example of an inevitable digital
  transformation of this segment. Simple on the surface core component makes the
  service much more accessible for the broader audience.  It also gives Artinfo
  countless benefits such as an ability to maintain and monetize an archive of
  past auctions, acquire new customers and finally expand the art market in
  Poland.    Naturaily worked agile with Artinfo. We were open for every change
  in the architecture of the project to fit our client’s need as accurately as
  possible. Artinfo live auctions have started as a much smaller and static
  application. As the time went on, more features were being implemented making
  it more advanced with each change.  Our application now provides a listing of
  available art with an extremely sophisticated search engine. Artinfo employee
  can manage the service using CMS as well as dedicated panels for employees or
  helpers.

step-three-title: Advanced solutions require advanced tools
step-three-text: >-
  Live auctions require the best tools available to ensure stability and fast
  bid processing. Is it essential for the application to work/operate in real
  time.    We chose Ruby on Rails for the backend. Ruby on Rails is a mature
  technology. It allowed us to develop the core structure of the application in
  no time. The framework is a perfect choice for API creation. Artinfo wasn’t a
  typical project. We run into some unconventional problems. The Ruby on Rails
  community allowed us to find solutions for every issue we have encountered.
  Lastly, Ruby on Rails allowed us to implement WebSockets with ease.  Sometimes
  biddings are very rapid. They can last for only a few seconds. This is the
  reason why we had to choose a high-performance framework to power the frontend
  side of the application.  Our choice has fallen on Vue.js. We used it to
  develop the CMS and employee, user and helper panels. The site changes as the
  auction goes on. That is why we have implemented reactive components such as
  currently offered artwork, the seller or price.  From the developers’ point of
  view, Vue.js is much easier to pick up and use in a project than React. Oh,
  Vue is also more performant!  An interesting thing to note about this project
  is that it utilizes two databases. For the time being, we had to integrate our
  application with the old client’s system. Artinfo’s database is based on MySQL
  and currently contains users’ info.  Before the development process, it used
  to be a home for over 10-year old data. We’ve transferred it to a more
  performant and rich with features PostgreSQL database. Ultimately, all data
  will be migrated to the PostgreSQL database at the future stages of the
  development.

  The cooperation between Artinfo and Naturaily has resulted in an increased
  number of customers on Artinfo website. More and more art enthusiasts are
  interested in buying art online. The process of auction storing has been
  significantly optimized, Artinfo can now easily monetize the archives.
