step-one-title: Art auction house
step-one-text: >
  Artinfo is a web platform that offers not only a sophisticated catalog of art
  pieces and auction houses but also it is an amazing source of information
  about the art market in Poland and Europe. It has launched over 18 years ago.
  <br><br> With constant changes in the market, Artinfo was seeking an
  opportunity to expand and improve their service with new features and
  functionalities. <br><br> Artinfo used to receive bids via email or phone.
  This is why the implementation of online live auctions was Artinfo's and our
  primary focus - it significantly changes the way the company operates, for the
  better of course!

step-two-title: Live auctions of artworks
step-two-text: >
  Artinfo provides auction houses with an easy to use platform for handling
  online real-time bidding during auctions. <br><br> Artinfo is a broker between
  auction houses and the customers for which they provide access to the online
  live auctions. Clients no longer have to be physically in the house in order
  to make a bid - with the help of Naturaily, now they can do it remotely.
  <br><br> This real-time web application is an example of an inevitable digital
  transformation of this segment. Simple on the surface core component makes the
  service much more accessible for the broader audience. <br><br> It also gives
  Artinfo countless benefits such as an ability to maintain and monetize an
  archive of past auctions, acquire new customers and finally expand the art
  market in Poland. <br><br> Naturaily worked agile with Artinfo. We were open
  for every change in the architecture of the project to fit our client’s need
  as accurately as possible. Artinfo live auctions have started as a much
  smaller and static application. As the time went on, more features were being
  implemented making it more advanced with each change. <br><br> Our application
  now provides a listing of available art with an extremely sophisticated search
  engine. Artinfo employee can manage the service using CMS as well as dedicated
  panels for employees or helpers.

step-three-title: Advanced solutions require advanced tools
step-three-text: >
  Live auctions require the best tools available to ensure stability and fast
  bid processing. It is essential for the application to operate in real time.
  <br><br> We chose Ruby on Rails for the backend. Ruby on Rails is a mature
  technology. It allowed us to develop the core structure of the application in
  no time. The framework is a perfect choice for API creation. Artinfo wasn’t a
  typical project. We run into some unconventional problems. The Ruby on Rails
  community allowed us to find solutions for every issue we have encountered.
  Lastly, Ruby on Rails allowed us to implement WebSockets with ease. <br><br>
  Sometimes biddings are very rapid. They can last for only a few seconds. This
  is the reason why we had to choose a high-performance framework to power the
  frontend side of the application. <br><br> Our choice has fallen on Vue.js. We
  used it to develop the CMS and employee, user and helper panels. The site
  changes as the auction goes on. That is why we have implemented reactive
  components such as currently offered artwork, the seller or price. <br><br>
  From the developers’ point of view, Vue.js is much easier to pick up and use
  in a project than React. Oh, Vue is also more performant! <br><br> An
  interesting thing to note about this project is that it utilizes two
  databases. For the time being, we had to integrate our application with the
  old client’s system. Artinfo’s database is based on MySQL and currently
  contains users’ info. <br><br> Before the development process, it used to be a
  home for over 10-year old data. We’ve transferred it to a more performant and
  rich with features PostgreSQL database. Ultimately, all data will be migrated
  to the PostgreSQL database at the future stages of the development.
