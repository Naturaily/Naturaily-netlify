about-title: About
about-subtitle: About ArtInfo
about-column-1: >
  Artinfo is an art-center portal, operating since 2000. From the start, it has
  been the main source of information for collectors, art dealers, investors
  and art lovers. It has a vast archive containing all the necessary data about
  past auctions and their results. The artworks base exceeds 400,000 pieces.
about-column-2: >
  More than just an information page, Artinfo is also a broker between auction
  houses and art lovers who wanted to take part in the auction. Bidding orders
  were received by phone, which generated a lot of work for the entire team.

challenge-subtitle: The challenge
challenge-column-1: >
  Artinfo was a home for over thousands of data, much of it 10 years old,
  and the database was in MySQL.
  <br><br>
  We needed that data to create Artinfo Live, so we decided to migrate it all
  to more performant PostgreSQL database, rich with features.
challenge-column-2: >
  Simultaneously, we also started the new web application development process.
  The requirements were clear; we had to create an easy-to-use platform for
  handling online real-time bidding during auctions. <strong>Consequently,
  the main challenges were stability and fast data processing.</strong>
