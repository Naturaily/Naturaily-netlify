  with Woolman, we provided Shopify development and integration services,
  solving most complex cases for Shopify customers.

step-one-title: Shopify integration with external systems
step-one-text: >-
  Shopify offers a lot of features but lacks e.g. ready-to-use solutions
  simplifying orders management (on the European market).<br><br> If you need
  something extra, like a shipping list generated in real time - you need a
  dedicated application. <br><br> Together with Woolman, we designed the custom
  external software integrations for some of the top e-commerce brands. This
  included warehouse management system, loyalty system, product data management
  system, gift cards and many more.

step-two-title: Integrating existing external systems with e-stores on Shopify

  One of the custom integration was Nordic Shipping App which enables data
  exchange between the Shopify store and the shipping company in real time.
  <br><br>This way, it is possible to generate waybills and set new pickup
  points visible to customers while shopping. <br><br>The second custom Shopify
  application is responsible for the integration of data such as customer data,
  stock balance, order status, product data, product prices, gift cards, asset
  updates, etc. <br><br>Thanks to the integration, when new data is entered in
  one of the external systems, it also automatically appears in the online store
  (and vice versa).<br><br>

step-three-title: External authentication and verification system
step-three-text: >-
  Suomi.fi is a e-identification system that enables the citizens of Finland and
  the European Union to be recognized in a safe way by using various
  identification media such as bank-id and mobile certificates.<br><br>One of
  the integrations has been implemented to enable customer identification with
  the use of external suomi.fi system.<br><br>The integration allows e-store
  customers to pass authentication very quickly. The whole process is
  time-saving, 100% safe and secured. To make it possible, we have used SSO
  (single sign-on) - a property of access control of multiple related, yet
  independent, software systems. With this property, an e-shopper logs in and
  logs out with a single click.

step-four-title: Fully integrated Shopify ecosystem
step-four-text: >-
  Thanks to the custom integrations of the Shopify store, the customer has
  become more effective by:


  * Sending orders from Shopify to Oscar system (with data translation from JSON
  to .xml and field mapping).


  * Integration of inventory and prices in online pharmacy store.

  * Automatic update of product images based on a media bank.

  * Automatic update of the privacy policy and regulations that the customer
  must accept before finishing buying process.


  As you can see, the integration possibilities between Shopify and external
  systems are almost limitless.
