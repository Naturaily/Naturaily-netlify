about-column-1: >-
  Etno Cafe is a&nbsp;Polish coffee concept that includes a&nbsp;coffee shop chain,
  coffee roastery and cold brewery. The brand was created 9&nbsp;years ago in&nbsp;Wroclaw,
  and now <strong>it is one of the most recognizable coffee brands in the&nbsp;country</strong>,
  and soon to establish itself abroad as well. Etno Cafe puts great attention to&nbsp;detail into
  their daily work, ensuring the highest possible standards. 
about-column-2: >-
  This is the source of their <strong>undeniable success</strong>.
  The roastery was launched in&nbsp;2013 and the first coffee shop was opened in&nbsp;2015 
  – now there are 20&nbsp;of them in 7 different Polish cities. The third and final part of the
  Etno business, the coffee brewery, was launched in&nbsp;2016 and now the Cold Brew Coffee is one
  of the brand's favorite products, especially during the summer.

goal-step: Goal
goal-header: What the client wanted to achieve
goal-column-1: >-
  For Etno Cafe’s owners, their website is <strong>a&nbsp;vital way of expanding brand awareness
  and reaching out to new customers</strong>. As&nbsp;such, they wanted it to&nbsp;be performant,
  stable, secure and in&nbsp;line with the newly established look and&nbsp;feel of&nbsp;the brand.
  <br><br>
  <strong>Information transparency, the ability to&nbsp;easily edit website content, and an&nbsp;increase
  in&nbsp;users’ interactions</strong> were also some of the&nbsp;main goals the client wanted to achieve.
  This was mostly due to&nbsp;the wide range of the&nbsp;offer, the&nbsp;seasonal menus in&nbsp;each
  of the&nbsp;coffee shops, and&nbsp;an&nbsp;overall willingness to&nbsp;keep customers informed.
goal-column-2: >-
  The new website was designed mostly for marketing and image-building purposes. Nevertheless, the
  <strong>growth in the&nbsp;number of&nbsp;visitors and B2B leads</strong> was also more than welcome,
  so we needed to&nbsp;develop some integrations with email marketing and lead generation tools
  to accommodate these additional benefits.
  <br><br>
  Summing up, Etno Cafe wanted their new website to be stable, secure and performant, but also visually
  appealing and memorable.

challenge-step: Challenge
challenge-header: What we had to face
challenge-column-1: >-
  Etno Cafe’s previous website was built on&nbsp;WordPress in&nbsp;2014, so it was not only
  out-of-date but also very vulnerable and prone to&nbsp;cyber attacks. It could cause
  a&nbsp;lot of troubles, such as&nbsp;SEO issues and data leakages. The main challenge was
  to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;proper alternative based on the&nbsp;client’s needs and future plans.
  <br><br>
  The new website was supposed to be <strong>stable</strong>, <strong>easy-to-manage</strong>
  (even by non-technical members of the organization), <strong>editable</strong>, <strong>user-friendly</strong>,
  <strong>fresh</strong> and <strong>secure</strong>.
challenge-column-2: >-
  That’s why, after in-depth analysis, we’ve decided to go with the Jamstack approach. 
  <br><br>
  <strong>Jamstack websites are known to&nbsp;be&nbsp;fundamentally more secure than WordPress</strong>
  because they don’t rely on a&nbsp;public database. What’s more, they don’t expose scripting and,
  if you serve them from a&nbsp;CDN, they don’t have a&nbsp;single point of&nbsp;failure.

  Etno Cafe gave us a&nbsp;free hand when it comes to choosing the technology. After 
  an&nbsp;in-depth analysis, <strong>we were sure the Jamstack approach is the best possible 
  choice</strong>. A&nbsp;highly performant website influences the user experience, increases
  user retention rates, causes a&nbsp;bump in SEO rankings and helps to achieve marketing goals.
  <br><br>
  Knowing that the visual and textual side of the project is as important to the client as the 
  technological reliability –&nbsp;<strong>we&nbsp;engaged several specialists</strong> who worked together
  to achieve these goals.

  The starting point of the project was to develop the content that would convey the brand's
  philosophy and be relevant to the target groups. The next step was UX/UI - and graphic design –
  all of which had to be <strong>in line with the new look and&nbsp;feel of the brand</strong>.
  <br><br>
  Having the content and graphic designs, we could go on to implementation. The choice of appropriate
  technologies and tools was not without significance.

  We chose <strong>Sanity (a&nbsp;headless CMS solution)</strong> because it is highly flexible
  and can be configured precisely to Etno Cafe’s needs. A headless CMS allows us to deliver content
  wherever we need — not only to a&nbsp;templated site, but even to many receivers at the same time,
  like e-stores or mobile apps. Sanity meets one of the key goals – content changes and edits can be made
  without any developer support, so Etno Cafe’s team members can easily update the menu, special offers
  and new coffee shop locations.

  To complete the Jamstack approach, we chose Netlify and Gatsby. <strong>Netlify is a&nbsp;content
  delivery network</strong> that ensures the website will be super-fast using global distribution
  and automated pre-rendering. It lets client create unlimited branches of the website.
  It&nbsp;has both built-in DNS management & SSL certificates, which results in less complexity when
  launching the website, and it’s all hosted in one place.

  <strong>Gatsby JS is the Static Site Generator</strong> (you can think of it as a website publisher)
  – it takes the input files needed and both converts and publishes them into a web-friendly format.
