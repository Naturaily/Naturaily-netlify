  Etno Cafe is a&nbsp;Polish coffee concept that includes a&nbsp;coffee shop chain, 
  coffee roastery and cold brewery. The brand was created 9&nbsp;years ago in&nbsp;Wroclaw,
  and now <strong>it is one of the most recognizable coffee brands in the&nbsp;country</strong>,
  and soon to establish itself abroad as well. Etno Cafe puts great attention to&nbsp;detail into
  their daily work, ensuring the highest possible standards. 
about-column-2: >-
  This is the source of their <strong>undeniable success</strong>.
  The roastery was launched in&nbsp;2013 and the first coffee shop was opened in&nbsp;2015 
  – now there are 20&nbsp;of them in 7 different Polish cities. The third and final part of the 
  Etno business, the coffee brewery, was launched in&nbsp;2016 and now the Cold Brew Coffee is one
  of the brand's favorite products, especially during the summer.

goal-step: Goal
goal-header: What the client wanted to achieve
goal-column-1: >-
  For Etno Cafe’s owners, their website is <strong>a&nbsp;vital way of expanding brand awareness
  and reaching out to new customers</strong>. As&nbsp;such, they wanted it to&nbsp;be performant,
  stable, secure and in&nbsp;line with the newly established look and&nbsp;feel of&nbsp;the brand. 
  <br><br>
  <strong>Information transparency, the ability to&nbsp;easily edit website content, and an&nbsp;increase
  in&nbsp;users’ interactions</strong> were also some of the&nbsp;main goals the client wanted to achieve.
  This was mostly due to&nbsp;the wide range of the&nbsp;offer, the&nbsp;seasonal menus in&nbsp;each
  of the&nbsp;coffee shops, and&nbsp;an&nbsp;overall willingness to&nbsp;keep customers informed. 
goal-column-2: >-
  The new website was designed mostly for marketing and image-building purposes. Nevertheless, the 
  <strong>growth in the&nbsp;number of&nbsp;visitors and B2B leads</strong> was also more than welcome,
  so we needed to&nbsp;develop some integrations with email marketing and lead generation tools
  to accommodate these additional benefits.
  <br><br>
  Summing up, Etno Cafe wanted their new website to be stable, secure and performant, but also visually
  appealing and memorable.
